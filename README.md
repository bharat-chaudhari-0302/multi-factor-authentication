Got it! Here's a concise and clean `README.md` for your **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) POC** project. It focuses on the tools used and how to run the POC without unnecessary details:

# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) POC

A simple Proof of Concept (POC) for implementing **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)** using Google Authenticator in a Spring Boot application.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **TOTP Library:** `GoogleAuthenticator` by Warren Strange
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Testing:** Postman or any HTTP client

---

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- An authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy)

### Steps to Run the POC

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bharat-chaudhari-0302/multi-factor-authentication.git
   cd multi-factor-authentication
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Access the endpoints:**

   - **Generate Secret Key and QR Code:**
     ```
     GET http://localhost:8080/totp/generate?username=your-username
     ```
     - This will return a **secret key** and a **QR code URL**. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.

   - **Verify TOTP Code:**
     ```
     POST http://localhost:8080/totp/verify?secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY&totpCode=123456
     ```
     - Replace `YOUR_SECRET_KEY` with the secret key from the previous step and `123456` with the code generated by your authenticator app.

---

## Example Workflow

1. Generate a secret key and QR code for a user (e.g., `username=testuser`).
2. Scan the QR code with Google Authenticator.
3. Enter the TOTP code from the app into the `/verify` endpoint to validate it.

---

## Dependencies

The project uses the following key dependencies (defined in `pom.xml`):

- `spring-boot-starter-web`: For building REST APIs.
- `google-auth-library`: For TOTP generation and validation.
